# Nemesis AI Enhanced Detection System

## Overview
The Nemesis AI has been enhanced with improved detection and collision systems to address the issues where the enemy was not detecting targets properly and was traversing through them.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Detection System (`NemesisDetectionHelper.cs`)
- **Target Validation**: Properly validates targets using layer masks and tags
- **Line of Sight**: Improved raycast detection with height offset to avoid ground collision
- **Field of View**: Enhanced field-of-view checks for more realistic detection
- **Collision Detection**: Added proper collision handling to prevent traversal

### 2. Collision System
- **Rigidbody**: Added Rigidbody component for physics interaction
- **Capsule Collider**: Configured proper capsule collider for realistic collision bounds
- **Collision Force**: Applies force when colliding with targets to create separation

### 3. Multi-Target Detection
- **Priority System**: NPCs have higher priority than players (NPC > Player1/Player2)
- **Fallback Logic**: Maintains backward compatibility with old detection methods
- **Layer Integration**: Properly configured layer masks for consistent detection

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Setup
1. Ensure your scene has the following GameObjects with proper tags:
   - Player1 (tag: "Player1")
   - Player2 (tag: "Player2") 
   - NPC (tag: "NPC")

### 2. Nemesis Configuration
1. Add the `NemesisAI.cs` script to your enemy GameObject
2. Add the `NemesisDetectionHelper.cs` script (will be added automatically if missing)
3. Configure the layer masks in the Inspector:
   - **Detection Layer Mask**: Set to include Player1, Player2, and NPC layers
   - **Sound Blocker Layer**: Set to include walls and obstacles that block detection

### 3. Using the NemesisTester
1. Add the `NemesisTester.cs` script to your Nemesis GameObject
2. Assign test objects in the Inspector:
   - Drag Player1, Player2, and NPC GameObjects to the test fields
3. Use the context menu options to test detection:
   - Right-click on the NemesisTester component
   - Select "Test Player1 Detection", "Test Player2 Detection", or "Test NPC Detection"

### 4. Visual Debugging
- **Red Sphere**: Detection radius
- **Yellow Sphere**: Sound detection radius  
- **Magenta Sphere**: Attack range
- **Colored Lines**: Detection rays to targets (enable in NemesisDetectionHelper)

## Layer Configuration

### Recommended Layer Setup:
```
Layer 8: PlayerLayer (Player1 and Player2)
Layer 9: NPCLayer (NPC)
Layer 10: ObstacleLayer (Walls, barriers)
Layer 11: SoundBlockerLayer (Doors, thick walls)
```

### Detection Settings:
- **Detection Layer Mask**: Include PlayerLayer + NPCLayer
- **Sound Blocker Layer**: Include SoundBlockerLayer + ObstacleLayer

## Troubleshooting

### Nemesis not detecting targets:
1. Check that targets have correct tags (Player1, Player2, NPC)
2. Verify layer masks include target layers
3. Ensure detection radius is large enough
4. Check for obstacles blocking line of sight

### Nemesis traversing through targets:
1. Verify NemesisDetectionHelper is attached
2. Check that "Enable Collisions" is true
3. Ensure targets have colliders (not triggers)
4. Verify collision radius is appropriate

### Detection not working for specific targets:
1. Use NemesisTester context menu to test individual targets
2. Check target layer assignment
3. Verify target has required components (PlayerHealth, NPCHealth)
4. Check for missing colliders on targets

## Performance Notes
- Detection runs every frame for optimal responsiveness
- Use appropriate detection radius to balance performance
- Layer masks significantly improve detection performance
- Debug visualization can be disabled in final builds

## Integration with Existing Systems
- **GameOverManager**: Automatically triggers GameOver when NPC dies
- **PlayerHealth/NPCHealth**: Integrated damage system
- **Horror Animator**: Uses Walk and Attack animations (no crawl)
- **NavMeshAgent**: Proper navigation with collision avoidance
